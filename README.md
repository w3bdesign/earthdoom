## What is Earth Doom?

Earth Doom is an epic war game that plunges you into a relentless fight for survival and dominance. As a leader of your own burgeoning nation, you must carefully build up your forces, gain critical resources, research powerful technologies, and conquer enemy lands - all while defending against those who would conquer you. The key to victory lies in properly balancing and adeptly managing the growth of your empire. Do you produce more scout units to search for additional resources and lands to conquer? Or do you focus on upgrading your resource production and building a stronger army?

Each decision you make can have significant consequences on your nation's future. One wrong move could leave your lands vulnerable or your armies outmatched. With every minute that passes, your empire gains resources that can be used to construct new buildings, train infantry units, and conduct valuable research to gain access to more advanced units and upgrades. But don't be lulled into a false sense of security - your enemies are also rapidly expanding their power. New threats could emerge at any time to challenge your supremacy.
